The Army on Monday issued two Request For Proposals (RFP) for procurement of 7,000 body-worn camera systems and 1,612 ballistic shields to be procured under Emergency Procurement (EP) through the fast-track procurement (FTP) route. The last date for bid submission for both the RFPs is December 20, 2022.


“The body cameras are for both the military police as well as Rashtriya Rifles engaged in counter-terrorist operations in Kashmir valley. The ballistic shields are meant for counter-terrorism operations,” a defence official said. The ballistic shields would be very helpful in preventing casualties in room interventions during anti-terror operations, the official added.


Emergency financial powers were granted to the armed forces by the Defence Ministry in the past on three occasions, post the Uri surgical strikes in 2016, the Balakot air strike in 2019 and the 2020 standoff with China in eastern Ladakh. Under the FTP route, the forces can procure weapons systems upto ₹300 crores on an “urgent basis without any further clearances to cut short the procurement cycle.”

Three tranches of EPs were executed under which 68 contracts worth ₹6,000 crores were placed and the fourth EP for indigenous equipment is underway, Army chief General Manoj Pande had said at DefExpo-2022.`
